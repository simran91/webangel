  Version 1.0
	- made changes as to how "updates" are done. we now do a select before any update
          then see if a select returned anything, then do a update or insert as required.
          Before i was just doing an 'update' and if that failed then doing a 'insert',
          but it wasn't working too well as i couldn't actually check if the update worked
          or not - as $result->resultStatus was returning PGRES_COMMAND_OK (as the command
          is okay, its just that the result is not! - anyway, its all fixed now :-) 
        - modified conf file to anyone can understand :-) 
        - changed directory structure (from everything in one directory! :-)

  Version 1.1
	- added -get_only option! 

* Tue Aug 25 19:58:52 EST 1998
  
  Version 1.11
	- modified the way in which the web interface html page passes the cgi script what to do.
          it should be more secure now, before people could have modified the html and 'posted'
          nested update statements but not now :-) 
          Now the html page passes things like "calculate 1" where "1" is defined in the cgi script, 
          and is not itself 'executed' as was previously the case!

  Version 1.3
	- now we use DBI (database interface) modules and not Postgres modules specifically, 
          so that if we want to change DB's, we can just by changing a variable that currently
          says: $databaseType = "Pg". We can now use MySQL, Oracle, Ingres or many many other
          databases and not have to change anything but that variable. I had to change some of 
          the ways i was accessing data (from using functions that Pg.pm provided to functions
          that the DBI module provides) but its well worth it as the code is now be used
          with virtually any db. 
          
* Mon Sep  7 09:39:06 EST 1998

  Version 1.31
	- now using db error state to check for errors rather than how many rows it returns,
          as that had bugs in it!
