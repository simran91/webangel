* Make the web interface look better and give it more flexibility. Somehow give it 
  the ability to do arbitrary SQL queries without comprimising security. 
  Also, because currently everything is printed out in one table, sometimes the table
  can get very large and browsers like Netscape have trouble rendering the table
  (if not crashing altogether!) 
 
* Iron out some bugs, eg. When the 'TITLE' of a page has '\' as its last character,
  webangel will not function properly, as it tries to do an:
		update URLTBL set ... URL = 'Whatever \' 
  see how that last ' got escaped... because of the \ character...!!! and now will
  be taken as a literal ' rather than signifying the end of the 'TITLE' field!
