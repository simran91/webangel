About

Webangel is a program that was written to collect various types of
info from the web that i have not currently found accessable
through search engines out there. 

It collects the following information about all the urls
it encounteres:

	* The title of the page 
        * What other links are within the page
        * How long it took to retrieve the page
        * What email address's the page contains
        * What cookies are set if visit the page
        * How many 'links' to other urls there are in the page! 
	* What type of server the url is served from (eg. Apache...)

Please mail comments/sugessitions to simran@cse.unsw.edu.au

Requirements
------------

1. Perl 5.002 or greater with the following modules installed:
	Socket           # comes with basic perl install
        FileHandle       # comes with basic perl install
        POSIX	         # comes with basic perl install
        Carp             # comes with basic perl install
        # Pg               # comes with PostgreSQL (no longer 'necessary')
        HTML::LinkExtor  # get from cpan ( see http://www.perl.com/ )
	URI::URL	 # get from cpan ( see http://www.perl.com/ )
        DBD		 # get from cpan ( see http://www.perl.com/ )
        DBI		 # get from cpan ( see http://www.perl.com/ )

2. Update: PostgresSQL (as below is NOT NECESSARY) you just need a 
   database. Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, Ingres anything will do as long
   as it has DBI/DBD perl modules. Just change the $databaseType 
   variable in the perl engine (currently set to "Pg" for postgres)

-- below kept for historical purposes --
2. PostgreSQL ( http://www.postgresql.org/ )
   Please install with perl5 support or if you already have PostgreSQL
   and just want to install the perl modules, download the postgres
   source, cd to src/interfaces/perl5 and follow the instructions there. 
-- above kept for historical purposes --

Getting started
---------------

1. Create a database called "webangel"
   (% createdb webangel) (if using postgres)
   - if you get a permissions error, log in as "postgres" and try again, 
     or maybe add yourself to the permissions list via 'createuser'

2. Create the talbes as in sql/create_tables.sql 
   (% psql -f sql/create_tables.sql webangel) (psql if using postgres)

3. Edit the configuration files to suit your needs!


Other

* Deleting a DB
  To delete a db you can use the 'destroydb' command. (if using postgres)
